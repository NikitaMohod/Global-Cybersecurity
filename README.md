Global Cybersecurity Analysis
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of global cybersecurity trends, offering insights into financial losses, affected users, attack types, and industry-specific impacts. Leveraging key performance indicators and detailed visualizations, this dashboard helps identify critical areas of vulnerability and informs strategic cybersecurity measures.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
Our analysis is built around several crucial KPIs, offering a snapshot of the cybersecurity landscape:

Total Financial Loss: Represents the aggregate financial impact of recorded cyberattacks, with the "K" indicating thousands (e.g., if the value is 100, it means $100,000). This figure highlights the substantial economic consequences of cyber incidents.
Total Affected Users: A significant metric indicating the widespread reach of cyberattacks, representing millions of users impacted globally.
Average Resolution Time: The average time taken to resolve cybersecurity incidents, providing a measure of incident response efficiency. While around 36.48 hours (approx. 1.5 days) is a reasonable timeframe, it still underscores the considerable effort required for mitigation and recovery.
Number of Attacks: This metric, while seemingly low compared to the other KPIs, provides context for the frequency of reported incidents.
Data Scope and Filters
The dashboard currently aggregates data from several key countries: Australia, Brazil, China, France, Germany, India, Japan, Russia, UK, and USA. A country filter allows for detailed regional analysis, though by default, all visualizations display global aggregated data.

Trend Analysis
Financial Loss by Year
The total financial loss due to cyberattacks has shown a volatile trend over the years. We observed a peak around 2017, a significant dip in 2018, and another spike around 2019, followed by a decline in 2020. Notably, while 2019 saw a relatively lower number of attacks, 2020 experienced a peak in attack issues compared to 2019.

Affected Users by Year
The number of affected users has also experienced significant fluctuations. A notable peak occurred around 2017, followed by a sharp decline in 2018, suggesting a year with fewer widespread incidents or improved preventative measures. Numbers rebounded strongly in 2019-2020 before a slight decrease into 2021.

Industry-Specific Impact
Financial Loss by Industry
Our analysis clearly shows that the IT and Banking sectors incur the highest financial losses from cyberattacks, standing out significantly from other industries. Government, Retail, Healthcare, Telecommunications, and Education sectors also face substantial losses, but at comparatively similar levels. This highlights the critical need for robust cybersecurity investments and strategies within the IT and financial sectors due to their elevated financial exposure.

Attack Type Distribution
Attack Source by Attack Type
The distribution of cyberattack types indicates a diverse threat landscape, requiring comprehensive defense strategies. While relatively evenly distributed, DDoS (17.7%) and Phishing (17.63%) are slightly more prevalent. Other significant attack types include SQL Injection (16.77%), Ransomware (16.43%), Malware (16.17%), and Man-in-the-Middle (15.3%). Organizations must implement multi-layered defenses to counter this wide array of attack methods.

Conclusion
This cybersecurity analysis project provides a vital overview of the evolving threat landscape. By highlighting significant financial losses, the millions of users affected, and the diverse array of attack types, it underscores the critical need for robust and adaptive cybersecurity strategies. The data clearly points to the IT and Banking sectors as primary targets and emphasizes the importance of comprehensive defenses against prevalent threats like DDoS and phishing. This dashboard serves as a valuable resource for understanding global cybersecurity trends, enabling data-driven decision-making to mitigate risks and enhance digital resilience for organizations worldwide.
